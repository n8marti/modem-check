# modem-check
Get useful info from Huawei modem using its API.
This Python script uses Python3 and has not been tested with Python2.
The code at src/\__main__.py causes the script to be run in a virtual
environment. That should be modified before trying to run it locally.
Also, the Requirements.txt file seems to be overly demanding. So please don't
depend on it when installing dependencies.
